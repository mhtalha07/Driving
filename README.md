# Intro
This repo is about to the driving unit of "Val" which is an AGV.

## Problem Define
* We have a plan to drive our AGV "VAL" using two front wheels powered by two motors. Differential drive method will be applied here.

## Study Cases
* **Locomotion**
* **Dynamics**
* **Kinematics**
  * Inverse kinematics for Differential Drive
  
**Construction of Differential Drive Kinematics**
* 2 wheels on the same axis
* 2 independent motors (one for per wheel)
* 3rd passive supporting wheel
